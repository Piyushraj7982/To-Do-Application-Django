## Overview

This project is a simple To Do List application built using Python and Django. It allows users to create, view, and manage their tasks. The application provides a form to add new tasks and displays a list of tasks with options to mark them as complete or delete them.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title and description.
- View a list of tasks with their details.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks.

*Data Model*

- ID (Auto-incremented)
- Title
- Description
- Action

Setup:

```
Create a new Django project and app:

```bash
django-admin startproject mytodo
cd mytodo

**Apply Migrations**

Apply the initial migrations to set up the database schema:

```bash
